# DeltaLiveTables


üöÄ Databricks Declarative Pipelines ‚Äì Full Overview
This repository contains notes, practice code, and key takeaways from a comprehensive learning journey into Databricks Declarative Pipelines using Delta Live Tables (DLT) and LakeFlow.

üìö Topics Covered
Introduction to Declarative Pipelines

Shift from code-based to logic-based pipeline development

Simplifies ETL by focusing on what to do, not how

LakeFlow Code Editor

UI-based development and orchestration of data pipelines

Delta Live Tables (DLT)

Declarative framework for building batch and streaming pipelines

Supports SQL and Python APIs

Automates orchestration, error handling, and retries

Streaming Tables & Materialized Views

Real-time and near real-time table updates

Efficient and scalable handling of continuous data streams

Medallion Architecture

Bronze (raw) ‚Üí Silver (cleaned) ‚Üí Gold (business)

Enables modular, layered data processing

Append Flow API

Simplifies incremental data ingestion in streaming pipelines

Data Quality Checks with Expectations

Built-in validations using EXPECT statements

Supports logging, dropping, or failing bad records

AUTOCDC (Automatic Change Data Capture)

Enables CDC without manual setup

Ideal for source systems that support insert/update/delete

Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)

Implemented in DLT using merge logic and AUTOCDC

Handles Type 1 and Type 2 changes efficiently

Dimensional Data Modeling

Star and Snowflake schema modeling

Best practices for analytical workloads

Monitoring and Governance

Built-in event logs, metrics, and audit trails

Integration with Unity Catalog for governance and lineage tracking

üß† Why Use Declarative Pipelines with DLT?
Simplifies ETL: Define logic, not orchestration

Reliable by Design: Built-in monitoring, retries, and quality checks

Supports Batch & Streaming: Unified API for real-time and scheduled pipelines

Scalable & Secure: Native integration with Unity Catalog and Lakehouse features

Time-Efficient: Less boilerplate, faster time-to-production

üîß Tools Used
Databricks Community Edition

SQL & PySpark

Delta Live Tables

Unity Catalog

LakeFlow Editor

üìù Summary
This course is a great starting point for understanding modern data engineering workflows on Databricks. It brings clarity to how Declarative Pipelines, Delta Live Tables, and the Medallion Architecture come together to create scalable, reliable, and production-ready pipelines.
